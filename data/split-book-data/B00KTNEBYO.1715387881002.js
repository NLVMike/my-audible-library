window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Inhuman</i> is Book 5 in the best-selling, smash hit phenomenon, Post-Human series. Listeners will get to rejoin all of the characters they fell in love with along the way in the previous 4 audiobooks. <i>Inhuman</i> not only ties the first four audiobooks together, it also introduces a new villain, one that has been lurking in the background throughout, and that will trump any villain in the history of literature, film, or comics. V-SINN is its name, and, this time, it may just be too much for the post-humans to handle. </p> <p><i>Inhuman</i> is to the Post-Human series as <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> was to Star Wars - the middle act when revelations emerge, old sins come back to haunt, and the journey of the heroes that listeners have fallen in love with deepens, darkens, and entertains to a whole new level. <i>Post-Human</i> fans will not be disappointed with this epic middle act! Enjoy!</p>";
