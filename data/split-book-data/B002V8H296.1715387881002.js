window.bookSummaryJSON = "In the year 2204, tragedy and terror forced a scientific team to prematurely evacuate Maleiva III. Nineteen years later, a rogue moon hurtling through space is about to obliterate the last opportunity to study this rare, life-supporting planet. With less than three weeks left before the disaster, superluminal pilot Priscilla \"Hutch\" Hutchins -- the only even remotely qualified professional within light years of the ill-fated planet -- must lead a small scientific team to the surface to glean whatever they can about its life forms and lost civilizations before time runs out. <p>But catastrophe awaits when they are stranded on this strange and complex world of puzzles and impossibilities. And now Hutch and her people must somehow survive on a hostile world going rapidly mad -- as the clock ticks toward apocalypse for a doomed enigma.</p>";
