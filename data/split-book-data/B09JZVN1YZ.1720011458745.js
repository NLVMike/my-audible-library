window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Book 4 in the Max Abaddon series.</b></p> <p>After losing two close companions, Max has finally come to terms with his heritage. As his job at the Atheneum continues to fade slowly into the past, his position on the Council is once again tested.</p> <p>This time The Dark Carnival is coming to town, and with it, an odd collection of Ethereals and Mages. With Planes Drifter headlining the first co-regular/Mage music festival, things, of course, donâ€™t go as planned. At least not for Max and the team.</p> <p>Max and the rest of the crew are quickly thrown into the middle of a string of vicious unconnected murders. With all the deaths appearing to be at the hands of various magical creatures and beings, it seems to be a clear open and shut case. Or is it...?</p> <p>Will the team figure out what is going on before the regular government intervenes? Again most importantly, will Max and Kim find time for a drink or two at their favorite bar, the Fallen Angel?</p> <p><b>Fans of Ben Aaronovitch, Jim Butcher, Ilona Andrews, Benedict Jacka, Kevin Hearne, Richard Kadrey, Shayne Silvers, Patricia Briggs, and BR Kingsolver will not want to miss this latest addition to the Urban Fantasy scene!</b></p>";
