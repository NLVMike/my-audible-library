Captain Jason Burke knows that along with the Machine, something else came back from the outer regions...something he's kept a secret from everybody, even his own crew. He knows that he likely has the power to stop the Machine in its tracks, but it means unleashing an equally uncontrollable force. As he struggles to know what the right thing to do is, he can't help but fear that the cure could very well be worse than the disease. </p> <p><i>The Pandora Paradox</i> is the 12th installment of the best-selling Omega Force series.</p>";
