window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the White Drake's war, the price of freedom is paid in blood and fire....</p> <p>For hundreds of years, the Ironship Trading Syndicate was fueled by drake blood - and protected by the Blood-blessed, those few who could drink it and wield fearsome powers. But now the very thing that sustained the corporate world threatens to destroy it. A drake of unimaginable power has risen, and it commands an army of both beasts and men. </p> <p>Rogue Blood-blessed Claydon Torcreek, Syndicate agent Lizanne Lethridge, and Ironship captain Corrick Hilemore have been spread to disparate corners of the world, but they are united in their desire to defeat the White Drake and the Spoiled who follow it.</p> <p>Humanity itself is at stake, but with the aid of ancient knowledge, revolutionary technology, and unexpected allies, all hope is not lost. Saving the world will require sacrifice, as Clay, Lizanne, and Hilemore will see all they know either consumed by flames or reborn from the ashes. </p>";
