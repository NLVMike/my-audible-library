window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The White Lich has fallen. </b></p> <p>The remnants of his army have fled into the forests. It should be a time of celebration. But as Dante regroups his people, the Angel of Taim arrives with a message.</p> <p>They may have defeated the lich, but Taim is still going to destroy the mortal world of Rale.</p> <p>Facing starvation in the dead of winter, Dante leads his people toward the abundant fields of Gallador Rift. Along the way, though, a horrifying illness breaks out among the travelers. As earthquakes rattle the land and volcanic eruptions black out the sky, it becomes clear that the plague was only the first attack launched against Rale. Their only hope is to travel back to the Realm of the Gods and try to bargain with them - and if that fails, to wage war on them. But the only known doorway to the Realm is hundreds of miles away. In the throes of collapse, flooded with monsters from hellâ€™s darkest depths, the entire world might be torn apart before Dante and Blays have the chance to start fighting back.</p>";
