window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An atmospheric tale of corruption and abduction set on Mars, from the author of the award-winning science fiction novel <i>Altered Carbon</i>, now an exciting new series from Netflix. </p> <p><b>Named one of the best books of the year by </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>Hakan Veil is an ex-corporate enforcer equipped with military-grade body tech that’s made him a human killing machine. His former employers have abandoned him on a turbulent Mars where Earth-based overlords battle for profits and power amid a homegrown independence movement. But he’s had enough of the turbulent red planet, and all he wants is a ticket back home - which is just what he’s offered by the Earth Oversight organization, in exchange for being the bodyguard for an EO investigator. It’s a beyond-easy gig for a heavy hitter like Veil...until it isn’t.</p> <p>When Veil’s charge starts looking into the mysterious disappearance of a lottery winner, it stirs up a hornet’s nest of intrigue and murder. And the deeper Veil is drawn into the game, the more long-buried secrets claw their way to the Martian surface. Now it’s the expert assassin poised against powerful enemies hell-bent on taking him down - by any means necessary. </p> <p>Praise for <i>Thin Air</i>:</p> <p>“Kick-ass.... Mixed in with the thriller-esque action and cyberpunk backdrop is a hard-boiled noir story complete with a twisting and turning plot that keeps readers on their toes.” (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>) </p> <p>“Richard K. Morgan wants to destroy your Mars fantasies.... It’s a grim vision, but one that Morgan finds far more plausible than the cheerful visions of plucky Mars colonists common in sci-fi.” (<i>Wired</i>)</p> <p>“A robotically enhanced Jack Reacher [in a] dazzlingly intricate game of political double- and triple-cross, spiced with tastily kinetic battle sequences.” (<i>The Guardian</i>)</p> <p>“If you ever imagined that the core esthetics and themes of cyberpunk - lowlifes and high tech; corporate dominance; future noir; post-human evolution and cyborg adaptations; hardscrabble urban environments - were played out, <i>Thin Air</i> will set you straight, and kick your butt in the process.... Both kinematic and cinematic, [<i>Thin Air</i> is] limned by Morgan with balletic precision and smashmouth grace.” (Paul Di Filippo, <i>Locus</i>)</p> <p></p>";
