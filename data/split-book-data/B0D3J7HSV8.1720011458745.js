Even worse, answering the question of his own mortality.</p> <p>With the help of a few familiar faces and a new, rather grumpy demon raccoon, Max must figure out a way through hell to find and save Devin, dead or alive.</p> <p>Back home, things are also coming to a head with Max being out of the picture, as it’s time to explain a few things to the council…</p> <p><b>Fans of Ben Aaronovitch, Jim Butcher, Ilona Andrews, Benedict Jacka, Kevin Hearne, Richard Kadrey, Shayne Silvers, Patricia Briggs, and BR Kingsolver will not want to miss this latest addition to the urban fantasy scene!</b></p>";
