If you love Jasper Fforde, Ben Aaronovitch or</b><b><i> Doctor Who</i></b><b>, you won't be able to resist Jodi Taylor.</b></p> <p><i>'It's time, Max.'</i></p> <p>And so, a whole new chapter opens up.</p> <p>It's long been known that if a thing can go wrong, it will. With knobs on, usually. Disasters start to pile up. A new colleague with no respect for the past and a great deal to prove. Historians lost in time. And - worst of all - Rosie Lee on her very first jump. Then there's the small matter of Max's dishonourable discharge.</p> <p>From Tudor England to the Tower of Babel - it's all going horribly wrong.</p> <p>Jobless and homeless, Max receives an offer she can't refuse. Another time, another place. A refuge, perhaps.</p> <p>She's got that wrong, too.</p>";
