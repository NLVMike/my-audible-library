Those days of hidden battles are rapidly coming to a close as Wizard Scout Richard Shepard and the crew of the recon ship Defiant find themselves dead center in the thickest of the fighting.</p> <p>Leading a combined force of UHAAV armored vehicles, ten-meter-tall giants, and human, elf, and dwarf magic users, Richard must take them to a place where even wizard scouts fear to tread: the gates of hell itself. </p> <p>Will even the help of Richardâ€™s wise-cracking battle computer Nickelo and the beautiful elf high priestess Jeena be enough? Only the angels know, and they aren't telling.</p>";
