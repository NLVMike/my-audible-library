His husband, Griffin Flaherty, wants to help - but how can he, when Whyborne won't tell him what's wrong? </p> <p>When a man from Griffin's past murders a sorcerer, the situation grows even more dire. Once a simple farmer from Griffin's hometown of Fallow, the assassin now bears a terrifying magical corruption, one whose nature even Whyborne can't explain. </p> <p>To keep Griffin's estranged mother safe, they must travel to a dying town in Kansas. But as drought withers the crops of Fallow, a sinister cult sinks its roots deep into the arid soil. And if the cult's foul harvest isn't stopped in time, Fallow will be only the first city to fall. </p> <p>Fallow is the eighth book in the Whyborne &amp; Griffin series, where magic, mystery, and m/m romance collide with Victorian era America. </p>";
