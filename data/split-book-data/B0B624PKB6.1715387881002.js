window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two teenagers fight for their place in a world where </b><b><i>everybody</i></b><b> has powers—and the fate of humanity may be in their hands—in this original superhero series. </b></p> <p>On July 6, 1963, human history was forever altered. From the depths of space, a golden wave of light bathed everyone on Earth in rays that rendered them unconscious. Six days later, five billion people awakened with superpowers. For thirty-seven years now, superhumanity has managed to keep the peace. With some exceptions . . .</p> <p>Matt Callaghan is a clairvoyant. Unfortunately, his uncanny talent for predicting the future has more to do with observation and psychology (read:<i> lying</i>) than actual superpowers. About to graduate from Northridge High, he <i>still </i>hasn’t developed any special abilities. And if the authorities discover the truth, Matt can safely predict he’ll be locked up as a scientific curiosity.</p> <p>Jane Walker is an Empath, feared and hated for her ability to assume other people’s powers by touching them. Expelled from various high schools for fighting bullies with a dazzling array of formidable abilities of their own, she’s determined to prove her worth and join the legendary Legion of Heroes.</p> <p>Tasked with employing his “clairvoyance” to monitor his new classmate, Matt must juggle protecting his secret inability and keeping Jane and his friends from killing each other. And when the Legion of Heroes offers Matt a place in their academy, his attempt to play off the organization’s history backfires into Jane getting accepted as well. </p> <p>As Matt bluffs his way through evaluation and Jane battles for her very life, the pair will soon learn the Legion’s true agenda is far from altruistic—and even farther from heroic...</p> <p><b>The first volume of the hit alternate-history series—with more than a million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible! </b></p>";
