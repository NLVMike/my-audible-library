It's a hot new look for me - literally, because it bursts into flames whenever I'm threatened. </p> <p>My magical makeover is all Gary's fault. I knew there was something off from the moment he transferred to my school. Go figure. He's a wizard with a trust fund and an inferiority complex. </p> <p>Now, thanks to him, I've graduated from high school bullies to supernatural terrors and that's not all.

Because if not, everything I hold dear will soon burn even hotter than my hair.</p>";
