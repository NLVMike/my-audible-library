Together, they will face death.</b></p> <p>Together, they will seek ascension.</p> <p>In the Domains, those born with magic have only one place where they can prove themselves worthy of it: the brutal pits of the arena, where they will either grow in power and build a following with every victory, or risk dishonor and death in defeat. For these “Gladiators”, the ultimate prize for their struggle is a place among the Chosen, the immortal rulers of that vast and decadent empire.</p> <p>Gavin is an unlikely warrior trying to find his place in the savagery of the arena. Sadira, a star Gladiatrix already favored by all. When happenstance brings them together, the pair set out to earn themselves a place at the Grand Championships, vying to see their names carved in the annals of history.</p> <p>With survival and immortality on the line, can they hold together against the vicious realities of the fighting grounds and the machinations of the Chosen?</p> <p>Monsters and magic await them.</p> <p>The white sands call for blood.</p>";
