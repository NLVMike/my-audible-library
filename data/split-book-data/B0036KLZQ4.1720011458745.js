window.bookSummaryJSON = "I'm no coward. I want to make that perfectly clear. But after my life turned into a horror movie, I take fear a lot more seriously now. I finally became Dr. Carrie Ames just eight months ago. Then I was attacked in the hospital morgue by a vampire. Just my luck. <p>So now <i>I'm</i> a vampire, and it turns out I have a blood tie to the monster who sired me. The tie works like an invisible leash, and I'm bound to him no matter what I do. And of course he's one of the most evil vampires on earth. With my sire hell-bent on turning me into a soulless killer and his sworn enemy set to exterminate me, things couldn't get much worse...except I'm attracted to them both.</p> <p>Drinking blood, living as an immortal demon, and being a pawn between two warring vampire factions isn't exactly how I'd imagined my future. But as my father used to say, the only way to conquer fear is to face it. So that's what I'll do. Fangs bared.</p>";
