Now what?</b></p> <p>A joint task force of humans and synthetic intelligences (SIs) has defeated the Overlord’s Fleet Twenty-Seven, and peace reigns throughout the region surrounding Earth...for now.</p> <p>But the Overlords are sure to return once they find out their fleet was destroyed, and they’ll be back with a strong enough force to ensure the Terrans don’t win a second time.</p> <p>Commander Lance Baker and Commander Sofia Jimenez have a brief moment in time and space to come to terms with their allies, train new forces—including new SIs—and prepare for a battle that is sure to be bigger and more horrific than anything they’ve seen before.</p> <p>Uplink Squadron has been successful to this point through a combination of skills and good luck, but the storm that’s coming will be strong enough to blow all of that away.
