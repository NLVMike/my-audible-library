window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You have right-wing relatives and friends. Sometimes you feel isolated because you believe you must keep your thoughts to yourself. After all, you are just not up for another fight. It does not matter how progressive or lefty you are. One can have a very enjoyable conversation with the most right-wing of relatives or friends. It is all about the approach.</p> <p>Over several years of being an activist, a radio host, a blogger, and a writer, I have interfaced in a positive manner with everyone of all stripes. That taught me how best to engage in a positive and non-confrontational manner. It means it has allowed conversations and exchanges that otherwise would not occur because one could not get past one’s defensive walls.</p> <p>This book explains what I have discovered about engaging with the right. We all have friends and relatives where we may think the relationship is over. But if we simply find the entry point of commonality, which believe it or not, there are many, the conversation will begin. One hundred percent agreement is never necessary. Dialogue is. </p> <p>I have used my techniques now for over a decade. I give various real-life examples and stories that I am sure you can use as well. I can tell you that my right-wing friends now seek me out for coffee and meaningful conversations.</p>";
