window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Avery Special is the world's only living necromancer, and she's pretty bad at it. She also just moved to LA, where trouble has been waiting for a necromancer. Trouble that doesn't care how strong she is or that she's only 15. Monsters, magical artifacts, occultists, and television producers only care that a real necromancer is back.</p> <p>There are definitely upsides. Chris, Annie, Sue, and Peggy have their own creepy superpowers and are the best friends a girl could hope to make on her first day in a new city. Her Pudgy Bunny coloring book can teach her more than a stack of grimoires. Her ghostly ancestors are so eager to help it's annoying.</p> <p>Not that she has time for any of that, because Chris and Sue are both in love with her.</p>";
