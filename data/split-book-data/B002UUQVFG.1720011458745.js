window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the Nevada desert, an experiment has gone horribly wrong. A cloud of nanoparticles (micro-robots) has escaped from the laboratory. This cloud is self-sustaining and self-reproducing. It is intelligent and learns from experience. For all practical purposes, it is alive. </p> <p>It has been programmed as a predator. It is evolving swiftly, becoming more deadly with each passing hour. </p> <p>Every attempt to destroy it has failed. </p> <p>And we are the prey. </p> <p>As fresh as today's headlines, Michael Crichton's most compelling novel yet tells the story of a mechanical plague and the desperate efforts of a handful of scientists to stop it. Drawing on up-to-the-minute scientific fact, <i>Prey</i> takes us into the emerging realms of nanotechnology and artificial distributed intelligence in a story of breathtaking suspense. </p> <p><i>Prey </i>is a novel you can't pause. </p> <p>Because time is running out.</p>";
