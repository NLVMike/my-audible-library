window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wizard scouts are the greatest fighting force the galaxy has ever seen. When there’s planet-sized trouble, sometimes only a wizard scout will suffice. After the citizens of Talos Seven discover a rich titanium vein on their planet, they think it will be a boon for all. That is, until the pirates show up. Soon the Talosians, young and old, are forced to work in the pit mine in return for the pirates’ protection. </p> <p>After the murder of the town’s mayor, young Anna finally has enough. Scrounging together as many credits as she can find, she takes off in a battered survey ship to find help for her beleaguered planet. What she finds is Wizard Scout Trinity Delgado. </p> <p>With time of the essence, Trinity gathers together five medically disabled wizard scouts to help her defend a planet from a vastly superior force of armored attack vehicles. To make matters worse, other forces are at play that threatens the entire galaxy. Caught between the pirates and an armada of the bat-like soldiers of the Crosoian Federation, Trinity and her ragtag band of mercenaries must somehow snatch victory from certain defeat in the face of impossible odds. What else is new?</p>";
