One of the few remaining is Wizard Scout Richard Shepard. </p> <p>In an all-or-nothing gambit, the bats have gathered the largest fleet of warships the galaxy has ever seen to destroy the weakened humans once and for all. The Empire's only hope for survival may well lie on the shoulders of Richard and the crew of the recon ship <i>Defiant</i>. </p> <p>Faced with the seemingly impossible task of ending the war before more are killed Richard must travel deep into the heart of the Crosoian Federation. Along with his elven bondmate Jeena and the rag-tag crew of the <i>Defiant</i>, Richard is forced to seek out the unlikeliest of allies: a Crosoian scout sworn to kill him and all he holds dear. </p> <p>With a demon army poised to invade the three galaxies, the success of the <i>Defiant</i>â€™s mission depends on retrieving an artifact from the very pits of Hell itself. Can even a wizard scout prevail?</p>";
