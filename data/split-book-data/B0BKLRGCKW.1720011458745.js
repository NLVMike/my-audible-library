Since traveling to the Plane and coming face-to-face with the Knights of the Old Gods, Max now finds himself in the crosshairs of a particularly nasty group of vampires.</p> <p>With vampire assassins and foulmouthed unicorns causing Max more than a headache, a personal matter has also risen from the grave. Once again, Max, Petro, Phil, and his closest allies are tested. This time it’s personal, and the crew has to quickly find who is behind the death mark placed on Max.</p> <p>Between Max’s struggle to stay one step ahead of his new adversaries and an emotional distraction, things are about to get bloody....</p> <p><b>Fans of Ben Aaronovitch, Jim Butcher, Ilona Andrews, Benedict Jacka, Kevin Hearne, Richard Kadrey, Shayne Silvers, Patricia Briggs, and BR Kingsolver will not want to miss this latest addition to the urban fantasy scene!</b></p>";
