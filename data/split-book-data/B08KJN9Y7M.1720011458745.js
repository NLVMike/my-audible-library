The apocalypse is getting worse.</b></p> <p>Rockland Barkclay was saved and pulled into an alternate realm moments before his death. He thought that sacrificing himself would save the Grotto and give them a chance to prosper. He wasn’t expecting to open his eyes, reborn on the altar.</p> <p>Gaia has ordered the Golems to protect humanity, but their \"protection\" against the environment is sending humanity to the brink of starvation. Rocky needs to find his family, and his only option is to search through survivors one by one. Every person saved increases the population of the Grotto, but is also another mouth to feed.</p> <p>After saving thousands and not finding a single familiar face, new intelligence reaches the Grotto: sending Rocky against a challenge that even the King of Apes couldn’t overcome.</p>";
