window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program includes a bonus conversation between Brian Herbert, Kevin J. Anderson, and Scott Brick.</b></p> <p><b>A legend begins in </b><b><i>Dune: The Duke of Caladan</i></b><b>, first in The Caladan Trilogy by </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best-selling authors Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.</b> </p> <p>Leto Atreides, Duke of Caladan and father of the Muad’Dib. While all know of his fall and the rise of his son, little is known about the quiet ruler of Caladan and his partner Jessica. Or how a Duke of an inconsequential planet earned an emperor’s favor, the ire of House Harkonnen, and set himself on a collision course with his own death. This is the story.</p> <p>Through patience and loyalty, Leto serves the Golden Lion Throne. Where others scheme, the Duke of Caladan acts. But Leto’s powerful enemies are starting to feel that he is rising beyond his station, and House Atreides rises too high. With unseen enemies circling, Leto must decide if the twin burdens of duty and honor are worth the price of his life, family, and love. </p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Books</b></p> <p>\"The audio version is an easy listen. The quick, action packed chapters are well performed, and as the disparate story lines begin to come together it's hard to press pause. Narrator Scott Brick's deep and interesting voice adds more pull to the quieter parts of the story.... All in all, a fun book and a great performance.\" (<i>Booklist)</i></p> <p>\"Characters are imbued with heroic voices, delivering colorful cadences that catch the ear. Scenes are masterfully undergirded by mounting tension and sinister manipulation...[narrator Scott] Brick turns in a rewarding performance.\" (<i>AudioFile Magazine)</i></p>";
