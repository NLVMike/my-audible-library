window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It's summertime for supervillains! </p> <p>Or maybe not, because for Penelope Akk, there is still one foe she has yet to defeat: her own reputation as Bad Penny. It's been a fun ride: fighting adult heroes, going to space, and inspiring the rest of her school to open up about their own powers. </p> <p>Sooner or later, that ride has to end, and with school out of the way Penny is hatching a mad scheme to end it on her own terms. Will that go smoothly? Of course not. Penny's left too many unsolved problems behind her already, like ghosts, seriously crazy friends, and angry little girls from Jupiter. </p> <p>One by one, they'll have to be dealt with before she can do battle with herself. She'd better hurry, because her parents are closing in. Whether she confesses or not, this time they will find out her secret. </p>";
