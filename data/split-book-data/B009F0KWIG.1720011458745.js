window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The humans have no magic and are hunted for sport, but that is about to change. War is coming.... </p><p>The Sun Dragon spawned nine lesser dragons which devoured their parent for the power the elder possessed. These young dragons fought for choice bits of the Sun Dragon, but each only managed to eat a portion, thus giving them specific powers. Over time, these foul dragons were hunted down and slain by heroes of old. When each body rotted away, nothing remained save for nine Jewels - each the lens of a dragon's left eye. These Nine Eyes, or Jewels, form the basis for all magic in the world. </p><p>The Haven Series is a fantasy epic about the Nine Jewels of Power, each of which represents a different form of magic. The Red Jewel, known as Sang, gives the wielder power over Blood Magic. The Blue, named Lavatis, can call the Rainbow and rules the Sky. <i>Amber Magic</i> is a short introductory book in this epic series of fantasy novels by best-selling author B. V. Larson.</p>";
