Apple products, indie music, food co-ops, and vintage T-shirts make them weak in the knees. They believe they're unique, yet somehow they're all exactly the same, talking about how they \"get\" Sarah Silverman's \"subversive\" comedy and Wes Anderson's \"droll\" films. <p>They're also down with diversity and up on all the best microbrews, breakfast spots, foreign cinema, and authentic sushi. They're organic, ironic, and do not own TVs. </p> <p>You know who they are: They're white people. And they're here, and you're gonna have to deal.

So kick back on your IKEA couch and lose yourself in the ultimate guide to the unbearable whiteness of being.</p>";
