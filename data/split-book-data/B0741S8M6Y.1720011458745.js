So Charyn sets out to educate himself - circumspectly. </p> <p>When Jarolian privateers disrupt Solidar's shipping, someone attempts to kill Charyn's younger brother as an act of protest. Threatening notes follow in the wake of acts of violence against the rex and his family, demanding action - build more ships or expect someone to die. </p>";
