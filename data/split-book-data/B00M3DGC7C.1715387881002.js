window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here are four stories derived from the same universe as the Koban series. Listening to the series is not required to understand and enjoy these stand-alone tales. </p> <p><i>Australian Krall</i>: A fully gene-enhanced Kobani woman finds herself trapped in total darkness and underground, pursued by hundreds of slavering, semi-sentient, maniacally aggressive, and hungry aliens. Walk with her on the dark side! </p> <p>\"Batsof a Leather Flock Together\" (short story): The wolfbat Flock Leader establishes a nest in virgin territory. The wily leader uses his cooperative experience with humans to try to forge hunting alliances with unfamiliar and aggressive native creatures. Not everyone wants to play nice. </p> <p><i>Kobani Kiddie Cappers</i> (novella): Howdo Kobani parents cope with children that are born with a contact telepathy gene, and have eidetic memory. Adults, who think teenagers act as if they know everything, never had an overconfident four-year-old super child, with a ripper cub as his partner in crime. Living to reach his teens might take superhuman luck. </p> <p><i>TheSmuggler and the Crime Lord</i> (novelette): When you land a known smuggler's ship in a ruthless Crime Lord's city using false registry, it's hard to convince a platoon of armed thugs that you're only shopping, and you don't owe the boss a cut of your action. If you're a Kobani captain, and buying drinks for friends in a spaceport bar, spoiling your evening and making threats is a bad idea, and a fatal mistake.</p>";
