window.bookSummaryJSON = "In an instant the world changed for Lieutenant General Michael O'Neal. His beloved Corps of the last remaining ACS destroyed beneath the guns of the Fleet, his staff shot before his eyes, arrested on the charge of war crimes, he faces a short, one-sided trial, a trip to the Fleet Penal Facility and a bullet to the back of the head while trying to \"escape\". <p>General Tam Wesley faces trying one of the most beloved heroes in the Federation, not to mention a friend of decades, on trumped up charges. His alternative is having the last corps of humans that haven't sold their souls to the Darhel be taken apart like a chicken. Then he finds out the bad news....</p> <p>With a new invasion from a previously unknown race threatening the Federation capital, Darhel Tir Dal Ron faces his ultimate nightmare: He is going to have to reinstate the one man human soldiers trust, a man with the power and knowledge to destroy the Darhel oligarchy forever. And instead convince him, against all logic, to save the Darhel.</p> <p>Somebody is going to die. General Michael O'Neal, Supreme Commander, Federation Forces, just has to pick.</p>";
