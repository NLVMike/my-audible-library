window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Dustin Graves has three days to live.</p> <p>The darkling mage has found himself in the company of scoundrels.

Well...maybe.</p> <p>If you like snarky heroes, snappy dialogue, and a bit of grit and gore, you'll love the second book in Nazri Noor's series of urban fantasy novels.
