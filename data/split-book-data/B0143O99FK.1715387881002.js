window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jim Butcher, the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of The Dresden Files and the Codex Alera novels, conjures up a new series set in a fantastic world of noble families, steam-powered technology, and magic-wielding warriors.... </p> <p>Since time immemorial the Spires have sheltered humanity, towering for miles over the mist-shrouded surface of the world. Within their halls aristocratic houses have ruled for generations, developing scientific marvels, fostering trade alliances, and building fleets of airships to keep the peace. </p> <p>Captain Grimm commands the merchant ship <i>Predator</i>. Fiercely loyal to Spire Albion, he has taken their side in the cold war with Spire Aurora, disrupting the enemy's shipping lines by attacking their cargo vessels. But when the <i>Predator</i> is severely damaged in combat, leaving captain and crew grounded, Grimm is offered a proposition from the Spirearch of Albion - to join a team of agents on a vital mission in exchange for fully restoring <i>Predator</i> to its fighting glory. </p> <p>And even as Grimm undertakes this dangerous task, he will learn that the conflict between the Spires is merely a premonition of things to come. Humanityâ€™s ancient enemy, silent for more than ten thousand years, has begun to stir once more. And death will follow in its wake.... </p>";
