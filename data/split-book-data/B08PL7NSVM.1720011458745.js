window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wizard scouts are the elite fighting force of the Intergalactic Empire, but even they have their limitations.</p> <p>The fate of three galaxies hangs in the balance as two massive space armadas assemble. With each side intent on the complete destruction of the other, the only sure thing is heavy losses along with acts of bravery that are beyond anyoneâ€™s right to expect.</p> <p>As the opposing fleets battle for existence, Wizard Scout Richard Shepard, his battle computer Nick, and the elf high priestess Jeena seek out dragon allies in the magical dimension who may hold the key to the success of battles past, present, and future. With promises already made and expectations high, Rick, Nick, and Jeena must use every trick at their disposal to keep the forces of darkness at bay for just a little while longer.</p> <p>But nothing is ever as it seems as Rick, Nick, and Jeena are forced to make choices that would try the strongest of hearts. Faced with overwhelming odds, the threesome is asked to do the impossible. But they are only human, computer, and elf. In the end, it will come down to two things: courage and sacrifice.</p> <p>Victory has a cost, and someone always has to pay the price. The only question is: Who has to pay it this time?</p>";
