Thirteen of them can only mean total hell.</p> <p>But there may be a way. Hecate, triune goddess of magic, whispers her forbidden secrets, showing Dustin a path too terrible to take: the Apotheosis, a ritual of five bloody blades that will finally grant the darkling mage the arcane might he needs to annihilate the Eldest. The result? Power overwhelming. The price?</p> <p>Everything he loves.</p>";
